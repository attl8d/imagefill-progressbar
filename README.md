# Image fill progressbar
Image fill progressbar is a small library which lets you 
transform 2 images into a progress bar. As the loading progresses
the second image fills in the first one. 

Take a look: https://attl8d.github.io/imagefill-progressbar/

There are still a few things to do, but the base functionality is there.
Let me know what you think or how it can be improved. 
I am also curious what you built with it.

Please open issues if you find anything and you are welcome to contribute
to make this small library great. 

How to use:

`Comming soon `
